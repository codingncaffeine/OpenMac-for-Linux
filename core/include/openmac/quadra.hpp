// Macintosh Quadra 650 machine: 68040 @ 33 MHz on the djMEMC/IOSB board.
// RAM + ROM with the read-triggered boot overlay, VIA1 (real 6522) + VIA2
// (IOSB's pseudo-VIA facade), the PIC ADB modem behind VIA1's shift register,
// the classic 343-0042 RTC/PRAM chip on VIA1 port B, DAFB video with 1MB
// VRAM, EASC+DFAC audio, NCR 53C96 SCSI over the shared target bus, and
// probe-safe SCC/SWIM2/SONIC stubs. Empty NuBus slot space bus-errors, which
// is what the Slot Manager's probes expect.

// Reference: Quadra 650 hardware dossier (register maps and boot sequence
// facts drawn from Apple Developer Notes for this board family and MAME as
// a behavioral reference). Clean-room.
