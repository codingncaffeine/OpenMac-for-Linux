// Sony 3.5" floppy drive mechanism, as an IWM/SWIM-equipped Macintosh sees it.
//
// The drive multiplexes ~16 status lines onto a single sense wire; which one is
// presented is chosen by a 4-bit address CA2:CA1:CA0:SEL driven by the controller
// (CA0-2) and the VIA (SEL). Commands go the other way: the address CA1:CA0:SEL
// picks a control register, CA2 carries the data bit, and a pulse on LSTRB latches
// it. The ROM's .Sony driver packs both directions into one byte D0, unpacked by
// its address routine at $435154 as CA1:CA0:SEL:CA2 -- so for a command the low
// bit is the data and the upper three select the register.
//
// Status lines are ACTIVE LOW: the value returned here is the electrical line
// level, so `false` means the condition is asserted. Inside Macintosh III-36
// states each polarity explicitly, e.g. "CSTIN is 0 only when a disk is in the
// drive", "WRTPRT is 0 whenever the disk is locked", "TK0 goes to 0 only if the
// head is at track 0", "DRVIN is always 0 if the selected disk drive is
// physically connected... otherwise it floats to 1".
//

// and polarities); SWIM Chip User's Reference Rev 1.5 pp.5-8; Guide to the
// Macintosh Family Hardware 2nd ed. Ch.9; Macintosh Classic Developer Note p.5
