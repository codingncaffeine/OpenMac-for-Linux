/// The drop box: one host folder kept in front of the Mac as a real HFS volume
/// on the second SCSI seat. A file dropped on the window lands in the folder,
/// and the volume is REPUBLISHED so the Mac sees it — no new disk per file, no
/// restart, nothing to drag to the Trash afterwards.
///
/// Republishing is a swap, not an edit. A mounted HFS volume is not the disk:
/// the guest caches its catalog, its extents and its allocation bitmap, so
/// writing a new file into the image behind its back leaves it reading
/// yesterday's catalog against today's blocks. The volume is instead flushed
/// and unmounted, rebuilt on the host, and put back — which is what happens
/// when a removable cartridge is swapped, and a sequence the System already
/// handles natively.
///
/// The stages are split across threads on purpose. Guest-side steps (the
/// unmount, the insert) only happen between frames on the emulation thread,
/// because injected traps belong to the thread that owns the CPU. The rebuild
/// is host file I/O and slow enough that doing it there would visibly stall the
/// machine, so it runs on a task in between. <see cref="Pump"/> drives one
/// stage per frame batch; everything else is the caller asking.
///
/// The Classic and Quadra use this; they differ only in which
/// native entry points do the unmount, the read and the insert, which is what
/// the three delegates are.
