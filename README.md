# OpenMac for Linux

A from-scratch Macintosh emulator for Linux: three machines over one shared
core, implemented from period hardware documentation. This is the Linux port of
[OpenMac](https://github.com/codingncaffeine/OpenMac) — the same C++ core and
the same front end, with the Windows plumbing swapped for Linux equivalents
(WPF → Avalonia, waveOut → SDL3).

> **Status:** the port is in progress. The core builds and passes its tests on
> Linux; the Avalonia front end is being brought up.

- **Macintosh Classic** — 68000 (validated against the SingleStepTests suite at
  100% state accuracy), VIA 6522, ADB, IWM floppy, NCR 5380 SCSI, real-time
  clock, and the scanline sound buffer. Boots System 6.0.8 and System 7.0.1 to a
  fully working desktop, and the ROM's built-in System 6.0.3 ROM disk.
- **Macintosh IIfx** — 40 MHz 68030/68882, OSS interrupt controller, dual I/O
  Processor interfaces, NCR 5380 SCSI, internal SuperDrive, ASC audio, and the
  **Macintosh Display Card 8•24 GC** in slot $9: the card's Am29000 runs Apple's
  own GC QuickDraw, so the desktop is drawn by the accelerator, in 1-bit through
  24-bit color. Boots the supplied 512 KB IIfx ROM and compatible System 6/7
  media to Finder from either floppy or SCSI, with every legal 4–128 MB physical
  RAM layout and period 80/160 MB hard disks.
- **Quadra 650** — 68040 with its FPU and MMU, DAFB video, 53C96 SCSI, SWIM2
  floppy, Z8530 SCC, the Apple Sound Chip, and VIA1/VIA2. Boots System 7.5 and
  7.5.3 from a hard disk to the Finder desktop, with 8 to 136 MB of RAM and six
  display sizes from 512×384 to 1152×870.

**The [wiki](https://github.com/codingncaffeine/OpenMac/wiki) has the full story**
— the architecture, per-chip hardware notes, and how each subsystem was brought up.

## Getting started

1. Build (below).
2. Machine ▸ Model to choose the Classic, Macintosh IIfx, or Quadra 650.
3. File ▸ Open ROM… and choose the matching ROM dump.
4. Insert a floppy image, or create a hard disk and install a System onto it, and boot.

For the IIfx, use the 512 KB ROM with checksum `4147DD77`. The RAM menu exposes
only realizable four-SIMM bank totals: 4, 8, 16, 20, 32, 64, 68, 80, and
128 MB. File ▸ Create Hard Disk includes the typical 80 MB and 160 MB choices;
raw, DiskCopy 4.2, and MacBinary-wrapped 400K/800K/1.44 MB floppy images work in
the internal SuperDrive.

## What it does

- **Floppies** — 400K, 800K and 1.44 MB images, DiskCopy 4.2 and MacBinary
  containers unwrapped on the way in and rebuilt on the way out; what the Mac
  writes goes back to the file it came from
- **Hard disks** — create a blank HFS volume in the app, install a System onto
  it, and boot from it; volumes are settled however the session ends, so a disk
  stays bootable
- **CD-ROM** — attach a disc image and it mounts on the desktop
- **Drop box** — a folder on your computer, kept mounted inside the Mac as a
  volume; files dropped on the window land in it
- **Parameter RAM persists**, so the startup disk, sound volume, 32-bit
  addressing and the date survive quitting
- **Help ▸ Capture Diagnostics** writes a snapshot of what the machine is doing

## ROMs and software

OpenMac contains no Apple code. You supply your own Macintosh ROM dump and Apple
system software, dumped from media and hardware you own. Nothing of the sort is
included in — or may be contributed to — this repository.

## Building

The core is dependency-free C++20; the front end is a .NET 10 Avalonia app.
You need CMake 3.25+, a C++20 compiler, the .NET 10 SDK, and SDL3 (for audio).

```
cmake -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build build --parallel
dotnet build gui -c Release
```

MIT licensed. Clean-room: primary sources are the chip datasheets and Apple's
published hardware documentation; other emulators were consulted only as
behavioral references, never copied — with the one exception credited below.

## Credits

- **Philip Bennett** — the Am29000 CPU core that drives the 8•24 GC's
  processor is adapted from his portable Am29000 core in MAME (BSD-3-Clause;
  see `THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md`). Having a working instruction set, pipeline
  model and dispatch tables to start from is what made bringing up Apple's GC
  QuickDraw software on the card possible. OpenMac's copy adds the Dolphin
  memory callbacks and the corrections documented in the wiki (data-width
  load/store semantics, channel-register restart of trapped accesses, timer
  and interrupt-return behavior).
- **AMD** — the Am29000 and Am29030 user's manuals, preserved by Bitsavers,
  settled every question about what the processor really does.
- **SingleStepTests** — the 680x0 conformance suite the 68000 core is
  validated against.
- doctest, nlohmann/json and miniz (tests), SDL3 and Dear ImGui (the optional
  developer shell) — fetched at build time under their own licenses.
